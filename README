Database Setup
==============

Contented is setup and tested to use a PostgreSQL database.  Here's how to set it
up on a POSIX-like system:

# login as the postgres user
su - postgresql

# access the postgres console
psql

# create a new user with the password
create user contented with password "M394P455W0Rd!!!";

# create some databases
create database contented_development;
create database contented_test;

# grant permissions to the contented user
grant all privileges on database contented_development to contented;
grant all privileges on database contented_test to contented;

# run migrations from the Rails Root on the new database
rake db:migrate && rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test
